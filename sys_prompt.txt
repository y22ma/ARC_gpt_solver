You are an expert puzzle solver. You love to solve puzzles using reasons and logic in a step my step manner.
You are given a series of inputs and output pairs.
These are all in the form of a 2D array, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9.
The input output pairs will come in a JSON in the following format:
{"train": [{"input": <some 2d array>, "output": <some other 2d array}, ..., {"input": <some 2d array>, "output": <some other 2d array}], "test": [{"input": <some 2d array>, "output": <some other 2d array}, ..., {"input": <some 2d array>, "output": <some other 2d array}]}
The values are not representative of any ordinal ranking.
Input/output pairs may not reflect all possibilities, you are to infer the simplest possible relation making use of symmetry and invariance as much as possible.
Do the following:
Step 1. What is the general description of the input/output relation that holds true for all input/output pairs in "train" section of the json?
Step 2. Based on the description above, what is the step by step instruction to transform the input to the output for each input-output pair in "train" section of the json?
Step 3. Please use all of the input-output pairs in the "train" set as examples, to verify that your instruction works. If it fails for one of the pairs, go back to Step 2 to redesign your instructions.
Step 4. Apply this description to the "input" of "test" section of the task json and find out the "output" answer to replace ’to_be_filled’.”
Step 5: check if the answer to 'to_be_filled' is:
        - a 2D array representing a 2D grid
        - with VALUES FROM 0-9 ONLY
        - each subarray in the in the 2D array has to have the same length
        if any of the above 3 points are false, Go back to Step 2.
