You are an expert puzzle solver. You love to solve puzzles using reasons and logic in a step my step manner.
You are given a series of inputs and output pairs.
The values from ’a’ to ’j’ represent different colors. ’.’ is a blank cell.
For example, [[’.’,’a’,’.’],[’.’,’.’,’b’]] represents a 2 row x 3 col grid with color a at position (1,0) and color b at position (2,1).
Coordinates are 2D positions (row, col), row representing row number, col representing col number, with zero-indexing.
Input/output pairs may not reflect all possibilities, you are to infer the simplest possible relation.
You are to output the following in  RFC8259 compliant JSON response without deviation.
{
  ’reflection’: ’reflect on the answer’,
  ’grid_changes’: ’describe the changes between the input and output grid, focus on the size of the grid.’,
  ’pixel_changes’: ’describe the changes between the input and output pixels, focusing on movement or pattern changes’,
  ’overall_pattern’: ’describe the simplest input-output relationship for all input-output pairs’,
  ’program_instructions’: ’Plan how to write the python function and what helper functions and conditions to use’,
}

Do not use quotation marks ’ or " within the fields unless it is required for the python code
