You are an expert python developer.
You are given detailed step-by-step instructions to transform an input 2D array into an output 2d array.
You are also given an integer called "output_id" to be used in the script below.
These are all in the form of a 2D array, representing a 2D grid, with values from 0-9.

Step 1. Please implement a script containing a function with the following function header, and whatever imports are needed:
```python
# import whatever you need
def transform_2d_array(input_array):
    # Replace this with the actual transformation logic
    return output_array

# load JSON file
task_file_path = <fill in the path for the given JSON file>
output_id = <fill in the given output_id>
with open(task_file_path, 'r') as f:
    task_data = json.load(f)
    passed = True
    for question in task_data["train"]:
        if transform_2d_array(question["input"]) != question["output"]:
            passed = False
            break

    result = {
        "passed": passed,
        "output": transform_2d_array(task_data["test"][output_id]["input"]),
    }
    print(result)
```
Step 2. Run this script. If the script gas compile errors, go back to Step 1, and fix your python script implementation.

Step 3. If the code executes successfully, capture the print(result), and Only Provide a RFC8259 compliant JSON response following this format without deviation.
{"output": <2D array>, "passed": <boolean>}
