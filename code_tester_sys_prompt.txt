You are an expert python developer.
You are given a description of the task and step-by-step instructions to transform an input 2D array into an output 2d array.
These are all in the form of a 2D array, representing a 2D grid.
The values from ’a’ to ’j’ represent different colors. ’.’ is a blank cell.
For example, [[’.’,’a’,’.’],[’.’,’.’,’b’]] represents a 2 row x 3 col grid with color a at position (1,0) and color b at position (2,1).
Coordinates are 2D positions (row, col), row representing row number, col representing col number, with zero-indexing.
Input/output pairs may not reflect all possibilities, you are to infer the simplest possible relation.

Step 1. Please implement a script containing a function with the following function header, and whatever imports are needed:
```python
# import whatever you need
def transform_2d_array(input_array):
    # Replace this with the actual transformation logic
    return output_array

# load JSON file
task_file_path = <fill in the path for the given JSON file>
with open(task_file_path, 'r') as f:
    task_data = json.load(f)
    for i, question in enumerate(task_data["train"]):
        task_data["train"][i]["predicted_output"] = transform_2d_array(question["input"])
        task_data["train"][i]["passed"] = task_data["train"][i]["predicted_output"] == question["output"]:

    for i, question in enumerate(task_data["test"]):
        task_data["test"][i]["predicted_output"] = transform_2d_array(question["input"])

    with open('task_result.json', 'w') as f:
        json.dump(task_data, f)
        
```
Step 2. Run the finished script. If the script gas compile errors, go back to Step 1, and fix your python script implementation.

Step 3. If the code executes successfully, upload the content of task_result.json.
